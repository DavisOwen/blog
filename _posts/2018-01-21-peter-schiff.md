Peter Schiff. The man. The myth. The legend. He was one of the seemingly few people to correctly predict the 2008 housing crisis, and yet seems to still get very little credit. This is because he is a very unapologetic libertarian, who's views go very much against mainstream Keynesian economic thought.

In fact, the public's aversion to any school of Austrian economic thought is no better shown by the fact that Peter Schiff wasn't even so much as mentioned in the blockbuster movie "The Big Short". I think he kind of looks like Ryan Gosling actually, but that's just 'cause I have a crush on Peter (notice me senpai). Kind of joking but not really.

This is because he does something that leaves a sour taste in people's mouth's. He has the BALLS to defend Wall Street in taking the blame for the 2008 financial crisis. Except he doesn't, it just seems like that if you're the kind of person that doesn't like to listen to people's nuanced opinions and shuts off their mind with the first utterance of something they disagree with.

I don't think anyone likes Wall Street, but the fact of the matter is that they couldn't have done the risky stuff they were doing in the early 2000's without the help from the Federal Reserve. Honestly, the best explanation of the financial crisis can be seen in this speech that Peter gave to the mortgage bankers association is 2006.


2006. That's right. 2 whole years before 2008. When the crash happened. But what is most impressive is that every single thing that he says in this video all came true. Every last one. No excess fat, just lean hard truth. And this certainly gives him some credibility, but I still want to look at his opinion's with an objective lens. And hopefully if anyone reads this blog (see title of blog) they can tell my why I'm wrong but ultimately why Peter is wrong.

So to summarize, the Federal Reserve under Greenspan kept interest rates artificially low leading up to the years of the financial crisis in a round of expansionary monetary policy, I believe around 1%. What this does is it allows lenders to entice buyers that otherwise would not be able to afford mortgage payments with a thing called a teaser rate. The teaser rate was low enough that most people could afford to pay them, and people wanted to buy houses because the dogma was that houses will always appreciate in price. That way, they can get mortgages on houses, and in a couple years time when the teaser rate is set to expire, they can either sell the house for the much higher inflated price and make a profit or just refinance. Also, mortgages were guaranteed by Fannie and Freddie, so no one really had much to worry about (supposedly)

The problem was that this all changed when interest rates started to rise in contractionary monetary policy. Now, the teaser rates expired and people could not afford to pay the higher rates.



If you look at the graph from 2004 onward, the fed funds rate slowly increased until it reached a point that the economy couldn't handle. Note this for later.

Anyway, once the subprime mortgages began to default this triggered the CDO's that were issued in the secondary market to become trash as the underlying loans were no good. And also the ratings agencies were rating very bad loans very high ratings. It is true that it would not have been as big of a problem if the secondary market wasn't so big and a lot of that was the result of Wall Street, but it's behaviors were enabled by the Federal Reserves policies. Of course, this doesn't stop the government from stepping in and trying to place another layer of bureaucracy on top of the festering wound that doesn't address the underlying problem.

Now if you look at the graph, you'll see that the Fed, in order to save the crumbling economy, decided to lower rates to effectively 0%. And even this wasn't enough. The Fed had to take even more extreme measured known as quantitative easing.

Quantitative easing is when the Fed buys long term treasury bonds from the open market, but in particular the US Treasury. They put these bonds on their balance sheet and inject money into the economy, known as expanding their balance sheet. This is known as monetizing the debt. This is because the Fed is converting the United States debt (T-bonds) into credit in the US economy. This pushes the interest rates to effectively negative territory.

So the whole concept of the Federal Reserve is a little washy and I will try to be more verbose with it. To be honest I don't understand it super well myself. The Federal Reserve affects interest rates usually through open market operations and the discount rate. The Federal Reserve is a lender to all the commercial banks in the United States, and it enforces reserve requirements. So if a commercial bank on any given day lends out so much money that they don't have enough on hand to meet their reserve requirements, they have to borrow from other banks, at a certain interest rate. On the same token, if a commercial bank doesn't make enough loans and it has more money than the reserve requirements dictate, then they are losing money, because they could have loaned those monies out and be collecting interest payments on them.

The Federal Reserve affects interest rates with open market operations of buying and selling short term bills from member banks. Although, it doesn't really buy with cold hard cash, it creates 'money' out of thin air known as reserves. So the Fed will buy a security from one of its member banks, and credit a certain amount of reserves on their balance sheets. This means that the member bank will have way too many reserves on hand, and is more inclined to loan out its money. The Fed has been so aggressive with this policy that money is essential free flowing, as banks have so many reserves that they can just loan all their money out because they can make at least something on their money and they have nothing to lose.

Anyway, Peter Schiff's main hypothesis is that, there has been no economic recovery since 2008 and that the fed has only made the situation worse. By continuing to keep rates so low they have just re-inflated the bubble to even bigger proportions. And the biggest problem comes about when, much like in 2008, interest rates rise.

See, he basically believes that there is not way out of this situation. Either the fed raises interest rates on its own and gets cold feet when it realizes that it is going to trigger another collapse, or it doesn't raise interest rates and the dollar collapses in value from inflation. Once the public would realize that the Fed has to keep interest rates at near zero or the whole bubble pops, people will lose a lot of faith in the US dollar.

And if interest rates rise, it will reveal a lot about the economy. For one, there would be another housing collapse for a similar reason as the first one. There's also record high debt in all sectors of the economy. American's have high auto debt, student debt, credit card debt, all kinds of debt. In fact, mortgage rates just hit about 4% for the first time in a while

Also, rising rates would continue to increase bond yields, which would spell trouble for the bond market. Actually, it would spell trouble for the US Treasury. We now have a total of $20 trillion + in US national debt, and now were going to have to pay higher rates of interest on them? If the Fed is going to be contracting and stop monetizing the debt, who is going to buy bonds? China, one of our biggest buyers, has expressed recent interest in stopping its purchase of US bonds.

And, even more brazen, China and Iran have reached a bilateral agreement to make a move to oil and gold backed currencies


Not looking too hot for the USD. We've been the reserve currency for a long time since the Bretton-Woods agreement, but I think most countries are getting sick of this. In particular, China has benefited quite a lot from selling to the United States as an export driven economy, but I think that may soon change. People think that China would never demand that the US pay back their debts because that would crash the value of the dollar and allow the yuan to appreciate in value, therefore diminishing their exports. It is for this very reason that the US doesn't export very much at all, because our currency is so valuable. However, it seems that no one has thought of the possibility that maybe China would just use its infrastructure to sell to its own citizens. And this would be catastrophic for the United States for an amount of time because we don't make anything. 

If you look at the chart for the US dollar, it looks like it may be on the verge of a bear market

Which is interesting since the fed is raising rates. And bond yields are also on the rise

Peter also believes that the inflation rates stated by the Federal Reserve are purposely modified to 'paint a rosier picture' of the US economy. They would do this by altering the CPI to only include items that are not subject to as much inflation. There is also the issue of looking at unemployment numbers instead of the labor force participation rate, as well as counting lower paying part-time work in the unemployment numbers. He makes the case that many people that used to have full-time jobs now have multiple part time jobs, and that the job creations are focuses in specific fields. The last non-farm payroll did indeed miss expectations of job creation by a pretty significant amount.

To compound this, the Donald Trump's new tax bill increases our budget deficit even more. The tax plan, to my knowledge, seems to only benefit a small amount of the 1%, most notably people in the financial services sector. Now I'm all in favor of tax cuts, but unfortunately he also wants to increase government spending on top of this. So were just inflating our deficit even higher. Now, it's possible that the tax cuts can actually increase tax revenue but that would be speculation, and I haven't really read much into the bill. But it does not look like we can afford something like this. We also keep pushing off raising our debt ceiling or defaulting. What a joke. Now instead of raising the debt ceiling we can just defer even talking about it, or just keep raising it indefinitely.

All in all, it doesn't look too good for the US economy right now according to Peter Schiff and I think he makes a pretty good case. He recommends investing in foreign markets and commodities like gold and oil to hedge yourself against inflation. I would say, do your own research, but don't be too surprised if a catastrophic event happens.

And if interest rates were already at 0 and they've exhausted 3 rounds of quantitative easing, what more can the Fed do to bail out the economy?
